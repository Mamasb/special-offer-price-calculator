	# Special Offer Price Calculator

This program calculates the special offer price of an item based on the cost price, profit margin, and discount rate.

## Usage

1. Compile the program.
2. Run the executable.
3. Enter the cost price of the item.
4. Enter the profit margin (in percentage).
5. Enter the discount rate for the special offer (in percentage).
6. The program will calculate and display the special offer price.

## Example

Suppose you have an item with a cost price of $140, a profit margin of 30%, and a discount rate of 10%. The special offer price would be calculated as follows:

- Selling Price = Cost Price * (1 + Profit Margin / 100)
                = $140 * (1 + 30 / 100)
                = $182

- Special Offer Price = Selling Price * (1 - Discount Rate / 100)
                      = $182 * (1 - 10 / 100)
                      = $163.80

So, the special offer price for the item would be $163.80.

## Exercise

Try calculating the special offer price for different items with varying cost prices, profit margins, and discount rates using the provided program.
